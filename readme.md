# Lightweight Java EE 7 starter for Vaadin apps

This is a lightweight Vaadin app stub for creating Java EE7 apps.

This project uses pre-built client side, so Vaadin add-ons using 
client side don't work out of the box. You'll need to add Vaadin 
Maven plugin for compiling the GWT module. (Look into pom.xml, 
the relevant section is commented out.)
